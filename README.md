# Environmental-sounds-classification

Classification of variables that are on the environment are becoming more important since many devicesare able to interact with this kind of signals on many different contexts, this project aims to create and compare models that classify and recognize different sounds that come from different sources such as the human, animals, inanimate objects and natural soundscapes. The dataset is composed of more than 2000 environmental audio recordings that are labeled and eachsound clip is 5 seconds long. .

In this project different machine learning models were tested in the ESC-10 data set which is a reduced version of the ESC-50, that reduces the ambiguity between similar classes and therefore, allows a higher accuracy in the classfication task.

The preprocessing is described in detail in the article hda_project wherease the detailed jupyter notebook can be found as ESC_10 models evaluation
